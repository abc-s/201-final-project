## Project Description

Chekov is a web app that allows users to create a to-do list and add, edit, and delete individual tasks on their list. It also persists the user's to-do list across browser sessions using the browser's local storage. The app was built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript following responsive design principles. It is deployed on GitHub Pages at https://abc-s.github.io/201-final-project.
